        RideByMySide is the carpool of digital age. 
        Founded by 4 Masters students of SRH Heidelberg University as an Software Architecture Development
         project, this application serves as both Carpooling as well as a Dating website. 
        The rides are founded based on the journey details i.e. Source and Destination as well as common
        hobbies which are used to find their perfect match to go on a date. 
        So sit back and enjoy the Ride because you never know when you'll find your soulmate on this journey.</p>
